# AdGlare Ad Tag template for Google Tag Manager
Insert this tag once. Then manage all campaigns via your AdGlare Ad Manager portal.

Steps to take:

- Register for an AdGlare Ad Server account if you don't have one: https://www.adglare.com
- Set up your campaigns, create a zone and assign your campaigns.
- Prepare the variables needed:

- you can find the zID (zone ID) on the Properties tab of a zone.
- you can find the ad serving domain in the Ad Tag Generator of a zone.

What's left is to add a DIV or SPAN to your pages where the ads should be shown. It can be something like:

<span id=ad_placeholder_123></span>

In the GTM template, enter these variables and you should be ready to go. If you need further help setting this up, feel free to contact support. You can expect an answer within hours. Page: https://www.adglare.com/contact
